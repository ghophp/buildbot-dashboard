How to use with [runit](https://github.com/ghophp/buildbot-dashboard/wiki/runit).

## Manual Build
As this project is built in `go` you can build it in multiple platforms with:
```sh
$ go get -d github.com/ghophp/buildbot-dashboard
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ghophp/buildbot-dashboard
$ make
```
This will fetch the code and generate the assets as binary, then you can `go install` or `go build`, and then run:
```sh
$ buildbot-dashboard --buildbot="http://10.0.0.1/"
```
If you have `$GOPATH/bin` at your `$PATH` then you can run from everywhere the command.

You can also run with the `go run` with:
```sh
$ go run *.go -builbot="http://10.0.0.1/"
```

## Features
- Non-reload monitoring
- Enhanced UI with better visualization of the builders
- Easy usage with single command
- `Filter` options allow you to just show what matters
- Save arrangement of the dashboard
- `Zoom compliant` layout

## Preview
![Apache Board](/preview/preview_apache.gif?raw=true "Apache Board")

As we use gridster and a structured style, if your buildbot has a lot of builders, you can take advantage of the `browser zoom` to reduce the size of the blocks and so, use more space to move your grid.

## Martini
As this project is build over `martini` please consider setting this `env variables` when deploy:
```sh
export PORT=3000
export MARTINI_ENV=production
```

## Clean Cache
By default the project will cache the builders to avoid the delay of reloading it everytime. If you insert a new builder or remove one, you can force the reload of the cache in the UI, there is [a button on left side](https://github.com/ghophp/buildbot-dashboard/wiki/). This button will force the builders to be reloaded and the localStorage will also be cleaned.
